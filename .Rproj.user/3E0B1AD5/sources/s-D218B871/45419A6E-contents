The goal of {canlang} is to easily share language data collected in the
2016 Canadian census. This data was retreived from the 2016 Canadian
census data set using the
{[cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html)} R
package.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttimbers/canlang")
```

## Example usage

The data set `can_lang` lists the counts of how many Canadians report
each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most
often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which
language they have knowledge for. This data was recorded in the 2016
Census:

``` r
library(canlang)
head(can_lang)
#>                                  category               language mother_tongue
#> 1 Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages              Afrikaans         10260
#> 2 Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages             Akan (Twi)         13460
#> 3 Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages               Albanian         26895
#> 4                    Aboriginal languages              Algonquin          1260
#> 5 Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages American Sign Language          2685
#> 6 Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages                Amharic         22465
#>   most_at_home most_at_work lang_known
#> 1         4785           85      23415
#> 2         5985           25      22150
#> 3        13135          345      31930
#> 4          370           40       2480
#> 5         3020         1145      21930
#> 6        12785          200      33670
```

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot2::ggplot(data = can_lang,
       aes(x = most_at_home, y = mother_tongue, 
           colour = category, shape = category)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue3","red3","black")) +
    scale_y_log10(name = "Number of Canadians reporting the \n language as their mother tongue", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_log10(name = "Number of Canadians speaking the language \n as their primary language at home", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    annotation_logticks() +
    theme_bw()
