The goal of {canlang} is to easily share language data collected in the 2016 Canadian census. This data was retreived from the 2016 Canadian census data set using the {[cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html)} R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttimbers/canlang")
```
## Example usage

The data set `can_lang` lists the counts of how many Canadians report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for. This data was recorded in the 2016 Census:

```{r example-1}
library(canlang)
head(can_lang)
```

```{r example-plot-from-data, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.retina = 2}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot2::ggplot(data = can_lang,
       aes(x = most_at_home, y = mother_tongue, 
           colour = category, shape = category)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue3","red3","black")) +
    scale_y_log10(name = "Number of Canadians reporting the \n language as their mother tongue", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_log10(name = "Number of Canadians speaking the language \n as their primary language at home", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    annotation_logticks() +
    theme_bw()
```
