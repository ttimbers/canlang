The goal of {canlang} is to easily share language data collected in the 2016 Canadian census. This data was retreived from the 2016 Canadian census data set using the {[cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html)} R package.

This package contains two data sets:

1. [`can_lang`](#example-usage-of-can_lang): Contains the counts of the total number of Canadians that report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for.

2. [`region_lang`](#example-usage-of-region_lang): For each census division, it contains the counts of how many Canadians report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttimbers/canlang")
```
## Example usage of `can_lang`

The data set `can_lang` contains the counts of the total number of Canadians that report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for. This data was recorded in the 2016 Census:

```{r example-can_lang}
library(canlang)
head(can_lang)
```

```{r example-plot-from-data, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.retina = 2}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot2::ggplot(data = can_lang,
       aes(x = most_at_home, y = mother_tongue, 
           colour = category, shape = category)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue3","red3","black")) +
    scale_y_log10(name = "Number of Canadians reporting the \n language as their mother tongue", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    scale_x_log10(name = "Number of Canadians speaking the language \n as their primary language at home", 
                       labels = scales::comma) +
    annotation_logticks() +
    theme_bw()
```

## Example usage of `region_lang`

For each census metropolitan area (CMA), the data set `region_lang` contains the counts of how many Canadians report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, which language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for. 

```{r example-region_lang, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(canlang)
library(dplyr)
region_lang %>% 
    filter(region == "Vancouver") %>% 
    arrange(desc(mother_tongue)) %>% 
    head()
```

## Example usage of `region_data`

For each census metropolitan area (CMA), the data set `region_data` contains the statistics for number of households, land area, population and number of dwellings.

```{r example-region_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(canlang)
library(dplyr)
region_data %>% 
    arrange(desc(population)) %>% 
    head()
```

## Plain text, excel and SQLite database files

We have included several different plain text files, an excel files and a SQLite database file in this repo to be used for practice importing from these filetypes. Specifically, they are:

### Canada-level
+ [`can_lang.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.csv): the same dataset available via `canlang::can_lang` stored as a vanilla `.csv` file.
+ [`can_lang-meta-data.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/can_lang-meta-data.csv): the same dataset available via `canlang::can_lang` stored as a vanilla `.csv` file with two rows of metadata that should be skipped.
+ [`can_lang.tsv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.tsv): the same dataset available via `canlang::can_lang` stored as a `.tsv` (tab separated) file and has no column names.
+ [`can_lang.xlsx`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.xlsx): the same dataset available via `canlang::can_lang` stored as a `.xlsx` file. Can be read in using the {[readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)} package.
+ [`can_lang.db`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.db): the same dataset available via `canlang::can_lang` stored as a SQLite database (`.db`) file. Can be read in using the {[RSQLite](https://rsqlite.r-dbi.org/)} package.

### Census metroolitan area (CMA)-level
+ [`vancouver_lang.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/vancouver_lang.csv) & [`calgary_lang.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/calgary_lang.csv): data for Vancouver, BC and Calgary, AB, respectively, stored as a vanilla `.csv` file.
+ [`victoria_lang.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/victoria_lang.csv): data for Victoria, BC stored as a vanilla `.tsv` file.
+ [`kelowna_lang.csv`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/kelowna_lang.csv): data for Kelowna, BC stored as a `.csv` file (csv2 flavour) with metadata in the header and footer that should be skipped.
+ [`abbotsford_lang.xlsx`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/abbotsford_lang.xlsx): data for Abbotsford, BC stored as a `.xlsx` file where sheet 1 is the column names, and sheet 2 is the data with no column names. Can be read in using the {[readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)} package.
+ [`edmonton_lang.xlsx`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/blob/master/inst/extdata/edmonton_lang.xlsx): data for Edmonton, AB stored as a `.xlsx` file where all the data is in sheet 1.

## How this was made

The [`data-raw`](https://github.com/ttimbers/canlang/tree/master/data-raw) directory contains the the scripts necessary to create everything in this package, including the R data objects and the plain text, excel and SQLite database files.
