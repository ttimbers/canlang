# canlang

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of canlang is to easily share language data collected in the 2016 Canadian census.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttimbers/canlang")
```
## Example

The data set `can_lang` lists the counts of how many Canadians report each language as their mother tongue, which language they speak most often at home, whick language they use most often at work, and which language they have knowledge for. This data was recorded in the 2016 Census:

```{r example-1}
library(canlang)
head(can_lang)
```
